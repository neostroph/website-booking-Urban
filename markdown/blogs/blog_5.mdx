# Navigating Your First Home Purchase with Urban

Buying your first home is an exciting milestone, but it can also feel overwhelming. At Urban, we're here to guide you every step of the way. Understanding the process and preparing thoroughly can make your journey to homeownership smooth and enjoyable.

## Key Steps for First-Time Homebuyers:

* **Understand Your Budget:** Before you start house hunting, get a clear picture of what you can afford. This includes not just the mortgage, but also down payment, closing costs, property taxes, and insurance.
* **Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage:** A pre-approval shows sellers you're a serious buyer and gives you a concrete budget. It clarifies how much a lender is willing to loan you.
* **Define Your Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves:** Make a list of your priorities. Is a certain number of bedrooms essential? Do you need a backyard? Knowing your non-negotiables will streamline your search.
